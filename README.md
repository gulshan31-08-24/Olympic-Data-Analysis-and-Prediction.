## 📘 Introduction

The Olympics is a global sporting event with a rich history of data. This project aims to:

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on Olympic datasets
- Visualize trends across years, countries, and sports
- Analyze athlete statistics (age, gender, sports distribution)
- Predict future medal winning probability using **machine learning**
